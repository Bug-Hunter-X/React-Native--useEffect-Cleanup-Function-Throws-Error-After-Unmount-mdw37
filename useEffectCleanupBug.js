This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This often happens when the cleanup function attempts to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might be a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')` error or a similar type of error indicating that a component's state or prop is undefined.
